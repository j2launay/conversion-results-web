The most significant metastatic changes are found in the sacral bone and sacroiliac joint.\n*   **Pulmonary Comorbidities:** Additionally, she is diagnosed with other chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (J44.8) and an unspecified pneumonia (J18.9), possibly secondary.\n*   **Diabetes:** She has insulin-dependent diabetes (E11.5), without complications.\n*  **Pain:** The patient reports significant back pain radiating to her legs, particularly the left, exacerbated by sitting and standing, and while lying on her stomach.\n*   **Imaging:** Various imaging modalities including CT, MRI, and PET-CT scans confirm the presence of the primary lung tumor and bone metastases. The PET-CT indicates active metabolic activity in the tumors and metastases. The bone metastases appear to be osteolytic lesions.\n*   **Treatment:** Currently, the patient's treatment has included the management by physician Wacława Rybak-Bąk, and is in the early stages of assessment for palliative radiotherapy and pain management. The medical team has planned further investigations for potential palliative radiotherapy. There is ongoing assessment and management in a specialized oncology unit.\n*   **Referrals:** She has been referred for palliative radiotherapy and pain management. A consultation with a neurologist is also scheduled.\n\n**Key Concerns:**\n\n*   **Advanced Cancer:** Ms. Kolec is dealing with an advanced stage of lung cancer with metastases to bone, especially the sacrum.\n*   **Pain Management:** Her severe back pain significantly impacts her daily life, requiring immediate attention.\n*  **Complex Medical History:** The presence of COPD, diabetes, and other comorbidities adds to the complexity of her care and may impact treatment options.\n* **Radiotherapy Planning:** Ms. Kolec is currently being considered for palliative radiotherapy which indicates the focus is moving away from a curative approach.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Continued Oncology Management:**  Ms. Kolec requires ongoing care within the oncology unit with a focus on palliative therapy.\n*  **Palliative Radiotherapy and Pain Management:** Immediate implementation of palliative radiotherapy and effective pain management strategies are critical.\n*   **Neurological Evaluation:** Neurological consultation is needed for a comprehensive assessment of her pain and any neurological deficits.\n*  **Interdisciplinary Approach:** Collaboration between oncology, radiology, and pain management teams will be essential.\n\n**In Summary:** Ms. Kolec is a complex patient with advanced lung cancer and bone metastases experiencing severe pain. The focus of her care is shifting to palliative approaches, with a need for urgent intervention for pain control and further consideration of palliative radiotherapy. Close monitoring, medication adjustments, and continuous support are essential for her overall well-being.\n\nIf you need more detail on specific points, just let me know!"
