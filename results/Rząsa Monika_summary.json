    "summary": "Okay, here's an executive summary of the findings based on the provided documents for patient Monika Rząsa:\n\n**Executive Summary: Monika Rząsa - Orthopedic Case**\n\n**Patient:** Ms. Monika Rząsa, 35 years old (born 1989-02-08)\n\n**Presenting Problem:** Ms. Rząsa is experiencing ongoing complications following a Mason III fracture of the right radial head, initially treated with open reduction and internal fixation in November 2023. These complications involve pain, stiffness, and the development of heterotopic ossification (abnormal bone growth) around the elbow joint.  She is allergic to nickel.\n\n**Key Findings from the Provided Documents:**\n\n*   **Initial Injury:**  A Mason III fracture of the right radial head, treated with internal fixation using Herbert screws.  The injury also caused damage to the Posterior Interosseous Nerve (PIN).\n*   **Post-operative Progress:** Initially, there was improvement in range of motion (ROM) in supination (S), but not in pronation (R).  Full PIN function was regained after rehabilitation.  \n*  **Current Status (August 2024):**\n    *   Significant stiffness and limited ROM in the right elbow: S: 0-20-150, R: trace of rotation.\n    *   Active ossification sites are present in the area of the fracture, as confirmed by CT. The ossification is located between the radius and ulna.\n    *   The patient experiences pain that is not radiating, but the elbow is still used daily.\n    *   A scan of the skeletal system shows increased bone formation that is most prominent around the elbow joint and may be due to inflammatory processes. This could be the cause of the heterotopic ossification.\n    *   CT scan shows  post-operative ossification around the radial head, which is located in the tissue area, and also a bony bridge between the radius and ulna. \n*   **Diagnosis:** The patient's diagnosis includes:\n    *   Complications following a Mason III fracture of the right radial head.\n    *    Heterotopic ossification in the right elbow joint and possible inflammatory processes..\n    *   Damage to the PIN\n    *   The incident leading to the injury was a fall caused by slipping.\n    *  The diagnosis codes include S52.1 (Fracture of upper end of radius), W01 (Fall on the same level from slipping).\n*   **Recommended Treatment:**\n    *   Ms. Rząsa is being qualified for surgical treatment, including:\n        *   Resection of the radial head\n        *   Resection of heterotopic ossification in the elbow joint\n        *   Potential PIN revision\n    *   She was issued e-referrals to:\n       * Radiotherapy clinic (urgent referral due to ossification).\n       * Surgical Orthopedic clinic for the above mentioned procedures.\n*   **Additional Findings:**\n    *   The patient is being considered for radiation therapy.\n    *   Dental checkup recommended.\n    * The patient is to be kept under the care of the outpatient specialist clinic.\n\n**Overall Situation:**\n\nMs. Rząsa is experiencing complications following her initial fracture, specifically the development of heterotopic ossification, which is limiting her elbow function. Surgical intervention is being considered as the most appropriate option for this stage of treatment, along with the support of radiation therapy. The main goal is to restore function and reduce pain associated with her condition.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nThe patient has been referred for further consultations and possible surgery to address the ossification and potentially revise the PIN. She is also undergoing  preparatory procedures for the next stage of medical treatment, including a dental check-up.\n\nPlease note that this summary is based on the information provided in the documents and should be used in conjunction with the original records for comprehensive understanding."
