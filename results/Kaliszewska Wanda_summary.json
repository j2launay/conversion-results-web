    "summary": "**Executive Summary: Wanda Helena Kaliszewska, 93-year-old Female Patient**\n\n**Key Health Concerns:**\n\n*   **History of Cancer:** Ms. Kaliszewska has a significant history of cancer, including a left-sided mastectomy in 1996 and a left lower lung lobectomy in 2012 for lung cancer (adenocarcinoma acinosum G-II). Recent diagnostic results indicate a tumor (1.6x2.3x2.0 cm) in segment 3 of the left lung.\n*   **Cardiovascular Issues:** She presents with long-standing hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and multiple heart valve issues (mild aortic insufficiency, moderate/significant mitral and tricuspid regurgitation)\n*    **Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs):** She experienced a TIA in July 2023, and has experienced transient neurological symptoms on multiple occasions.\n*   **Other Chronic Conditions:**  Ms. Kaliszewska also has glaucoma, degenerative spinal disease, and left bundle branch block (LBBB).\n\n**Recent Findings:**\n\n*   **Pathology Report (August 2024):**  Indicated adenocarcinoma acinosum G-II of the left lower lung lobe.  Crucially, no cancer was found in lymph nodes tested from various locations around the lung and mediastinum, and the surgical margins were clear.\n*   **PET-CT Scan (August 2024):** Showed a metabolically active tumor in segment 3 of the left lung (1.6x2.3x2.0 cm, SUV max 9.5), along with other metabolically active findings in the liver and large intestine.\n*   **Chest CT Scan (June 2024):** Showed a 27x24 mm non-specific lesion in the left lung, suggestive of a tumor.\n*   **Neurological Evaluation:** Indicates no focal neurological damage at the time of the neurological exam, but the patient is being monitored due to the transient neurological events.\n\n**Current Symptoms:**\nMs. Kaliszewska currently experiences hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias. She has no reported pain.\n\n**Treatment and Management:**\n\n*   **Medications:** She is currently prescribed a range of medications including: Acard (antiplatelet), Amlopin (calcium channel blocker), Bibloc (beta-blocker), Kaldyum (potassium supplement), Piramil (ACE inhibitor), Toramide (diuretic), and Tritico CR (antidepressant).  She also uses eye drops for glaucoma.\n*   **Dietary Recommendations:** She has been advised to follow a low-fat, heart-healthy diet, restricting animal fats, salt, and processed foods.\n*   **Lifestyle:** Recommended to maintain moderate physical activity, adequate fluid intake (1.5-2 liters per day), and regular blood pressure monitoring.\n*   **Follow-up Care:** Regular check-ups with a primary care physician (POZ) are scheduled, in addition to specialists (cardiologist, ophthalmologist, and neurologist)\n*   **Pulmonology:** She needs a follow-up appointment with the pulmonology clinic, and will need further treatment planning by an oncology consultation.\n* **Holter EKG:** A 24-hour Holter monitor reading is pending and needs to be picked up from the neurology department when available.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   Ms. Kaliszewska has multiple complex, chronic medical conditions that need continued management by multiple specialists.\n*    Adherence to current medication regimen and dietary changes, as well as lifestyle modifications is advised.\n* The main priority is the recent left lung tumor identified on the PET scan, which needs further consultation and treatment planning by an oncology team.\n* Continued monitoring for cardiovascular conditions and neurological events is crucial.\n\n**Overall:** Ms. Kaliszewska requires a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to her care, addressing her history of cancer, cardiovascular issues, and other chronic conditions. The main focus needs to be on evaluating and treating the current lung tumor, while ensuring proper ongoing management of the existing conditions.\n"
