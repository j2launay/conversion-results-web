    "summary": "Okay, here's an executive summary of the findings for Mr. Leszek Mętel, based on the provided documents:\n\n**Executive Summary of Findings for Leszek Mętel**\n\n**Patient Overview:** Mr. Leszek Mętel, a 64-year-old male, was admitted emergently due to worsening dyspnea (shortness of breath), significant decrease in exercise tolerance, and weight loss. He has a history of smoking and alcohol use disorder.\n\n**Key Medical Findings:**\n\n*   **Respiratory:**\n    *   Significant right lung mass, highly suspected to be malignant, located near the hilum (area where major vessels enter the lung) causing complete blockage of the upper lobe and is actively infiltrating the pericardium, aorta and superior vena cava and surrounding lymph nodes.\n    *   Right pleural effusion (fluid buildup in the lining of the lung).\n    *   Chronic respiratory failure.\n*   **Cardiovascular:**\n    *   Congestive heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF<40%).\n    *   Mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency.\n    *   Tendency toward tachycardia (rapid heart rate) with ventricular and supraventricular premature beats.\n*   **Other Systemic Issues:**\n    *   Anemia (mild, macrocytic), iron and folate deficiency.\n    *   Vitamin D deficiency.\n    *   Enlarged prostate with some lymph node involvement.\n    *   Pancreatic cyst that needs further observation for malignancy.\n*   **Symptoms at Admission:**\n    *  Dyspnea (shortness of breath) and a significant decrease in exercise tolerance.\n    *   Visible collateral circulation veins on the abdomen.\n    *   Significant weight loss of approximately 5kg/month.\n\n**Diagnostic Findings:**\n\n*   **Imaging:**\n    *   Chest X-ray and CT scans confirm a large mass in the right lung. The mass is described as infiltrative, encompassing the bronchi, blood vessels, pericardium and superior vena cava.\n    *   CT scans also showed enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and supraclavicular area suggestive of metastatic spread.\n    *    Right pleural fluid was noted and thought to be linked to the tumor.\n*   **Laboratory:**\n    *   Elevated inflammatory markers.\n    *   Signs of anemia, iron and folate deficiency.\n    *   Vitamin D deficiency was confirmed.\n\n**Treatment:**\n\n*   Pharmacological therapy focused on the patient's condition and to address the dyspnea:\n    * Anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory medications.\n    * Diuretics and beta-blockers to address heart failure symptoms.\n    * Antibiotics were administered as needed.\n    * Vitamin and iron replacement.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Urgent Oncology Evaluation:** Mr. Mętel requires an immediate oncological evaluation to determine the most appropriate course of action for the lung tumor, including possible surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy.\n*   **Further Referrals:** He has been referred to Geriatrics, Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery for expert consult.\n*   **Follow-Up:** Regular monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and routine blood tests.\n*   **Dietary Recommendations:** Light, easy-to-digest diet, avoiding fried, spicy and heavy meals.\n*   **Medication Management:** Consistent and systematic adherence to prescribed medication is crucial.\n*   **Discharge Planning:** Patient was discharged with medications and planned for outpatient follow-up, including the urgent DILO card application.\n\n**Prognosis:**\nGiven the advanced stage of the lung tumor and its invasion into surrounding structures as well as cardiovascular complications, the patient's prognosis will depend on the efficacy of the further oncological treatment, adherence to medication and follow-up protocols.\n\n**In summary,** Mr. Mętel presents with a complex set of medical problems, primarily driven by an advanced lung tumor. He needs prompt oncological intervention, as well as continuing care for cardiac and other medical conditions. His prognosis is guarded, and ongoing monitoring and treatment are essential.\n"
